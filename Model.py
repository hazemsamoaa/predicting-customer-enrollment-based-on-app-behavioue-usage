#### Importing Libraries ####

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time

dataset = pd.read_csv('new_appdata10.csv')


#### Data Pre-Processing ####

# Splitting Independent and Response Variables
response = dataset["enrolled"]
dataset = dataset.drop(columns="enrolled")

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(dataset, response,
                                                    test_size = 0.2,
                                                    random_state = 0)


# Removing Identifiers for temporal purpose because at the end of the model we want to associate prediction to each user.
train_identity = X_train['user']
X_train = X_train.drop(columns = ['user'])
test_identity = X_test['user']
X_test = X_test.drop(columns = ['user'])

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_X = StandardScaler()
X_train2 = pd.DataFrame(sc_X.fit_transform(X_train)) # here we use dataframe because scaler return an array, whih remove the index (which requiered in order to map with user id) and column names which we need in our model training
X_test2 = pd.DataFrame(sc_X.transform(X_test))
X_train2.columns = X_train.columns.values
X_test2.columns = X_test.columns.values # assign columns to the new testing set
X_train2.index = X_train.index.values # assign columns to the new training set
X_test2.index = X_test.index.values
X_train = X_train2 # compare original training set with new training set.
X_test = X_test2

# Now all the features have normilized 

#### Model Building ####


# Fitting Model to the Training Set
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0, penalty = 'l1') # the penalty changed the model from regular logistic regression into regularized 
# even we handle the screen correlation by funnels, but it maybe also the funnels correlated to each other. So L1 which called Lasso, it penalizes any particular field that it's extremly correlated to the responsible variable. 
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting Test Set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating Results

precision_score(y_test, y_pred) # tp / (tp + fp) # check the overfitting 
recall_score(y_test, y_pred) # tp / (tp + fn) # out of actual positive observation how many we predict them as positive.
f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# plot confustion matrix

# Applying k-Fold Cross Validation

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
accuracies = cross_val_score(estimator = classifier, X = X_train, y = y_train, cv = 10)
